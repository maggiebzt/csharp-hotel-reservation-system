# csharp-hotel-reservation-system
The hotel reservation system is used by hotel staff to log and view room reservations. The system should allow users to make reservations, manage the price and quantity of rooms, and view a filterable report about reservations. 

### System Requirements
The system will at least have 4 windows:
1. Main Menu
2. New Reservation 
3. Room Management
4. Reservations Report

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the system up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
We used Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. It can be downloaded for free from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/

## Deployment

### Windows
To deploy the system, run the .exe file located in: csharp-hotel-reservation-system/Group5/bin/Debug/Group5.exe (file type is 'Application', not 'XML Configuration File')

### Mac
WineBottler seems to be a good solution for running .exe on Mac. Please let me know if you have a suggestion on running the system on Mac.
